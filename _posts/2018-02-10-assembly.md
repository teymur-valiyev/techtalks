# Assebly


## Register

To speed up the processor operations, the processor includes some internal memory storage locations, called registers.

There are ten 32-bit and six 16-bit processor registers in IA-32 architecture. 

The registers are grouped into three categories −

General registers,
Control registers, and
Segment registers.
The general registers are further divided into the following groups −

Data registers,
Pointer registers, and
Index registers.

### Data Registers




System calls are APIs for the interface between the user space and the kernel space.


### Nibbles
A nibble is a collection of four bits

### Bytes
Bits 0..3 comprise the low order nibble, bits 4..7 form the high order nibble. Since a byte
contains exactly two nibbles, byte values require two hexadecimal digits. 

Since a byte contains eight bits, it can represent 28, or 256, different values. Generally,
we’ll use a byte to represent numeric values in the range 0..255, signed numbers in the
range -128..+127

### Words

A word is a group of 16 bits. 


### Double Words
A double word is exactly what its name implies, a pair of words.


### Signed and Unsigned Numbers
with n bits we can represent the signed values in
the range -2n-1 to +2n-1-1. 

```
00000000	+0	0
00000001	1	1
⋮	⋮	⋮
01111101	125	125
01111110	126	126
01111111	127	127
10000000	−127	128
10000001	−126	129
10000010	−125	130
⋮	⋮	⋮
11111101	−2	253
11111110	−1	254
11111111	−0	255
```

1) Invert all the bits in the number
2) Add one to the inverted result

0000 0101 Five (in binary).
1111 1010 Invert all the bits.
1111 1011 Add one to obtain result.


### Shifts and Rotates
Another set of logical operations which apply to bit strings are the shift and rotate
operations. These two categories can be further broken down into left shifts, left rotates,
right shifts, and right rotates.


> shifting it left multiplies it by two.

If you shift a binary value to the left three times, you multiply it by eight (2*2*2)
If you perform n right shifts, you will divide that number by 2n


### The ASCII Character Set



Von Neumann architecture (VNA)

## Buses 

### The system bus
The system bus connects the various components of a VNA machine

### The Data Bus

### The Address Bus


### The Control Bus

The CPU
sends data to memory and receives data from memory on the data bus. This prompts the
question, “Is it sending or receiving?” There are two lines on the control bus, read and
write, which specify the direction of data flow


 The 80x86 family
deals with this problem by storing the L.O. byte of a word at the address specified and the
H.O. byte at the next location

### CPU Registers

AX –The accumulator register
BX –The base address register
CX –The count register
DX –The data register

Besides the above registers, which are visible to the programmer, the x86 processors also
have an instruction pointer register which contains the address of the next instruction to
execute. There is also a flags register that holds the result of a comparison. The flags register
remembers if one value was less than, equal to, or greater than another value. 


Because registers are on-chip and handled specially by the CPU, they are much faster
than memory

 Accessing a memory location requires one or more clock cycles. Accessing
data in a register usually takes zero clock cycles

### The Arithmetic & Logical Unit

For example, if you want to add the value five to the AX register, the CPU:
• Copies the value from AX into the ALU,
• Sends the value five to the ALU,
• Instructs the ALU to add these two values together,
• Moves the result back into the AX register. 

### The Bus Interface Unit
The bus interface unit (BIU) is responsible for controlling the address and data busses
when accessing main memory. If a cache is present on the CPU chip then the BIU is also
responsible for accessing data in the cache.

### The Control Unit and Instruction Sets


CBA Instruction
000 move
001 add
010 subtract
011 multiply
100 divide
101 and
110 or
111 xor
DD SS
DD -or- SS Register
 00 AX
 01 BX
 10 CX
 11 DX

 log2(n)


The move instruction would move data from the source register to the destination register
the add instruction would add the value of the source register to the destination register, etc.

###  The x86 Instruction Set

The instructions are mov (two forms), add, sub, cmp, and, or, not, je, jne,
jb, jbe, ja, jae, jmp, brk, iret, halt, get, and put. 

mov reg, reg/memory/constant
mov memory, reg


#### The arithmetic and logical instructions 

	add reg, reg/memory/constant
	sub reg, reg/memory/constant
	cmp reg, reg/memory/constant
	and reg, reg/memory/constant
	or reg, reg/memory/constant
	not reg/memory

The add instruction adds the value of the second operand to the first (register) operand,
leaving the sum in the first operand. The sub instruction subtracts the value of the second
operand from the first, leaving the difference in the first operand. The cmp instruction
compares the first operand against the second and saves the result of this comparison for
use with one of the conditional jump instructions (described in a moment). The and and or
instructions compute the corresponding bitwise logical operation on the two operands
and store the result into the first operand. The not instruction inverts the bits in the single
memory or register operand.

#### The control transfer instructions

ja dest -- Jump if above
jae dest -- Jump if above or equal
jb dest -- Jump if below
jbe dest -- Jump if below or equal
je dest -- Jump if equal
jne dest -- Jump if not equal
jmp dest -- Unconditional jump
iret -- Return from an interrupt

The first six instructions in this class let you check the result of the previous cmp instruction
for greater than, greater or equal, less than, less or equal, equality, or inequality

####  Addressing Modes on the x86

The x86 processors
support the register addressing mode10, the immediate addressing mode, the indirect
addressing mode, the indexed addressing mode, and the direct addressing mode. 


mov ax, [1000]
mov ax, [bx]
mov ax, [1000+bx]

The first instruction above uses the direct addressing mode to load ax with the 16 bit
value stored in memory starting at location 1000 hex.
The mov ax, [bx] instruction loads ax from the memory location specified by the
contents of the bx register. This is an indirect addressing mode


mov bx, 1000
mov ax, [bx]

are equivalent to the single instruction:

mov ax, [1000]

Of course, the second sequence is preferable

The last memory addressing mode is the indexed addressing mode. An example of this
memory addressing mode is
mov ax, [1000+bx]


#### 3.3.7 Encoding x86 Instructions

```
i i i r r m m m
i i i
000 = special
001 = or
010 = and
011 = cmp
100 = sub
101 = add
110 = mov reg, mem/reg/const
111 = mov mem, reg

r r
00 = AX
01 = BX
10 = CX
11 = DX

mmm
0 0 0 = AX
0 0 1 = BX
0 1 0 = CX
0 1 1 = DX
1 0 0 = [BX]
1 0 1 = [xxxx+BX]
1 1 0 = [xxxx]
1 1 1 = constant
```

```
0 0 0 i i m m m

i i
00 = zero operand instructions
01 = jump instructions
10 = not
11 = illegal (reserved)

mmm (if ii = 10)
000 = AX
001 = BX
010 = CX
011 = DX
100 = [BX]
101 = [ xxxx+BX]
110 = [ xxxx]
111 = constant
```


 For example, to encode the mov ax, bx instruction you
would select iii=110 (mov reg, reg), rr=00 (ax), and mmm=001 (bx). This produces the
one-byte instruction 11000001 or 0C0h.

```
0 0 0 0 0 i i i
i i i
000 = illegal
001 = illegal
010 = illegal
011 = brk
100 = iret
101 = halt
110 = get
111 = put
```

```
0 0 0 0 1 i i i
mmm (if ii = 10)
000 = j e
001 = jne
010 = j b
011 = jbe
100 = j a
101 = jae
110 = jmp
111 = illegal
```

jxx address
The jmp instruction copies the 16-bit immediate value (address) following the opcode
into the IP register. Therefore, the CPU will fetch the next instruction from this target
address; effectively, the program “jumps” from the point of the jmp instruction to the
instruction at the target address. 


Three of these instructions are illegal instruction opcodes. The brk (break) instruction
pauses the CPU until the user manually restarts it. This is useful for pausing a program
during execution to observe results. The iret (interrupt return) instruction returns control
from an interrupt service routine. We will discuss interrupt service routines later. The halt
program terminates program execution. The get instruction reads a hexadecimal value
from the user and returns this value in the ax register; the put instruction outputs the value
in the ax register.



#### Step-by-Step Instruction Execution
the mov reg, reg/memory/constant instruction:
• Fetch the instruction byte from memory.
• Update the ip register to point at the next byte.
• Decode the instruction to see what it does.
• If required, fetch a 16-bit instruction operand from memory.
• If required, update ip to point beyond the operand.
• Compute the address of the operand, if required (i.e., bx+xxxx) .
• Fetch the operand.
• Store the fetched value into the destination register

The Linux kernel was
entirely separate from the user interface, and it was protected from damage
due to malfunctioning programs elsewhere in the system. System memory
was tagged as either kernel space or user space, and nothing running in user
space could write to (nor generally read from) anything stored in kernel space.
Communication between kernel space and user space was handled through
strictly controlled system calls


Direct access to physical hardware, including memory, video, and periph-
erals, was limited to software running in kernel space. Programs wishing to
make use of system peripherals could only get access through kernel-mode
device drivers.

### Memory model


The oldest and now ancient memory model is called the real mode flat model

The newest memory
model is called protected mode flat model, and it's the memory model behind
modern operating systems such as Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7 and Linux.


Real mode flat model
is very much like protected mode flat model in miniature.

NAME VALUE IN DECIMAL VALUE IN HEX
Byte 1 01H
Word 2 02H
Double word 4 04 H
Quad word 8 08H
Ten byte 10 OAH
Paragraph 16 10H
Page 256 100H
Segment 65,536 10000H





The segment registers exist only to hold segment addresses.

The segment registers have names that reflect their general functions: CS,
DS, SS, ES, FS, and GS. FS and GS exist only in the 386 and later Intel x86
CPUs—but are still 16 bits in size. All segment registers are 16 bits in size,
irrespective of the CPU. This is true even of the 32-bit CPUs.

• CS stands for code segment. Machine instructions exist at some offset into a
code segment. The segment address of the code segment of the currently
executing instruction is contained in CS.
DS stands for data segment. Variables and other data exist at some offset
into a data segment. There may be many data segments, but the CPU may
only use one at a time, by placing the segment address of that segment in
register DS.
SS stands for stack segment. The stack is a very important component of the
CPU used for temporary storage of data and addresses. I explain how the
stack works a little later; for now simply understand that, like everything
else within real mode's megabyte of memory, the stack has a segment
address, which is contained in SS.
ES stands for extra segment. The extra segment is exactly that: a spare
segment that may be used for specifying a location in memory.
FS and GS are clones of ES. They are both additional segments with no
specific job or specialty. Their names come from the fact that they were
created after ES (think, E, F, G). Don't forget that they exist only in the 386
and later x86 CPUs!


these general-purpose registers
are used to hold the offset addresses that must be paired with segment
addresses to pin down a single location in memory.


The ''bitness'' of the world is almost entirely defined by the width of the x86 CPU
registers.

Adding a room to your house doesn't make it two houses—just
one bigger house.

There are eight 16-bit general-purpose registers: AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SI, DI, and SP.
They are all 16 bits in size, and
you can place any value in them that may be expressed in 16 bits or fewer.


When Intel expanded the x86 architecture to 32 bits in 1986, it doubled the size
of all eight registers and gave them new names by prefixing an E in front of
each register name, resulting in EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI, and ESP.


EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX, but there's an additional twist: the low 16 bits are themselves
divided into two 8-bit halves, so what we have are register names on not
two but three levels


The 16-bit registers AX, BX, CX, and DX are present as
the lower 16-bit portions of EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX; but AX, BX, CX, and
DX are themselves divided into 8-bit halves, and assemblers recognize special
names for the two halves. The A, B, C, and D are retained, but instead of the
X, a half is specified with an H (for high half) or an L (for low half). Each
register half is one byte (8 bits) in size.


BX there is BH and BL

### The Instruction Pointers

usually called IP or, in 32-bit protected mode, EIP

It can do
only one thing: it contains the offset address of the next machine instruction to
be executed in the current code segment.

A code segment is an area of memory where machine instructions are stored.

The current code
segment is that code segment whose segment address is currently stored in
code segment register CS.

Together, CS and IP contain the full address of the next machine
instruction to be executed.


The nature of this address depends on what CPU you're using, and the
programming model for which you're using it


#### The Flags Register


### The Three Major Assembly Programming Models

#### Real Mode Flat Model




CS always points to the current code segment, and the
next instruction to be executed is pointed to by the IP register



You can destroy portions of the operating system by careless use
of segment registers, which will cause the operating system to crash and take
your program with it. This is the danger that prompted Intel to build new
features into its 80386 and later CPUs to support a ''protected'' mode. In
protected mode, application programs (that is, the programs that you write,
as opposed to the operating system or device drivers) cannot destroy the
operating system or other application programs that happen to be running
elsewhere in memory via multitasking. That's what the protected means.

The 64-bit versions of the registers are renamed beginning
with an R: EAX becomes RAX, EBX becomes RBX, and so on.



Linux comes with its own linker, called ld.



Everything is a file.


When you read from a file, you are accepting
data from an endpoint. The path that the data takes between files may be
entirely within a single computer, or it may be between computers along a
network of some kind. Data may be processed and changed along the path, or
it may simply move from one endpoint to another without modification. No
matter. Everything is a file, and all files are treated more or less identically by
Unix's internal file machinery


Your keyboard is a file: it's an endpoint that generates data and sends
it somewhere. Your display is a file: it's an endpoint that receives data from
somewhere and puts it where you can see it. Unix files do not have to be text
files. Binary files (like the executables created by NASM and the linker) are
handled the same way.

					FILE C IDENTIFIER	FILE DESCRIPTOR 	DEFAULTS TO
Standard Input 		stdin 				0 					Keyboard
Standard Output 	stdout 				1 					Display
Standard Error 		stderr 				2  					Display


but it's good to know that the
power is there as your programming skills improve and you take on more
ambitious projects.


By convention in assembly language, the first (leftmost) operand belonging to a machine instruction is the destination operand.
The second operand from the left is the source operand.

Three different flavors of data may be used as operands: memory data, register
data, and immediate data.

you can move an
immediate value to memory, or a memory value to a register, or some other
similar combination, but you can't move a memory value directly to another
memory value. This is just an inherent limitation of the current generation of
x86 CPUs, and we have to live with it, inconvenient as it is at times.

to move the word in memory
at the address contained in EBX into register EAX, you would use the following
instruction:
mov
eax,[ebx]


EatMsg: db "Eat at Joe's!"
mov ecx,EatMsg

If you've had any exposure to high-level languages like Pascal, your first
instinct might be to assume that whatever data is stored in E a t M s g will be
copied into ECX. Assembly doesn't work that way. That MOV instruction
actually copies the address of EatMsg, not what's stored in (actually, at) EatMsg.
In assembly language, variable names represent addresses, not data!

So how do you actually ''get at'' the data represented by a variable like
EatMsg? Again, it's done with square brackets:
mov edx,[EatMsg]

EFlags as a whole is a single 32-bit register buried inside the CPU. It's the
32-bit extended descendent of the 16-bit Flags register present in the 8086/8088
CPUs

• OF: The Overflow flag is set when the result of an arithmetic operation
on a signed integer quantity becomes too large to fit in the operand it
originally occupied. OF is generally used as the ''carry flag'' in signed
arithmetic.


![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/eflags_register.png?raw=true "Title")

Several x86 machine instructions come in pairs. Simplest among those are INC
and DEC,


Every executable
program for Linux has to have a label _ s t a r t in it somewhere, irrespective of
the language it's written in: C, Pascal, assembly, no matter. If the Linux loader
can't find the label, it can't load the program correctly. The g l o b a l specifier tells
the linker to make the _ s t a r t label visible from outside the program's borders.

MyByte 		db 07h 			; 8 bits in size
MyWord 		dw 0FFFFh 		; 16 bits in size
MyDouble 	dd 0B8000000h 	; 32 bits in size

Think of the DB directive as ''Define Byte.'' DB sets aside one byte of memory
for data storage. Think of the DW directive as ''Define Word.'' DW sets aside
one word (16 bits, or 2 bytes) of memory for data storage. Think of the DD
directive as ''Define Double.'' DD sets aside a double word in memory for
storage, typically for full 32-bit memory addresses.


TwoLineMsg: db "Eat at Joe's...",10,"...Ten million flies can't ALL be wrong!",10

What's with the numeric literal 10 tucked into the previous example strings?
In Linux text work, the end-of-line (EOL) character has the numeric value
of 10. It indicates to the operating system where a line submitted for display to
the Linux console ends.

You can concatenate such individual numbers within a string, but you must
remember that, as with EOL, they will not appear as numbers. A string is a
string of characters. A number appended to a string will be interpreted by most
operating system routines as an ASCII character.


You can define string variables using DW or DD, but they're handled
a little differently than those defined using DB. Consider these variables:
WordString: dw CQ 1

DoubleString: dd 'Stop'
The DW directive defines a word-length variable, and a word (16 bits) may
hold two 8-bit characters. Similarly, the DD directive defines a double word
(32-bit) variable, which may hold four 8-bit characters.

A statement containing the directive EQU is called an equate. An equate is
a way of associating a value with a label. Such a label is then treated very
much like a named constant in Pascal. Any time the assembler encounters an
equate during an assembly, it will swap in the equate's value for its name. For
example: 

FieldWidth equ

The preceding tells the assembler that the label F i e l d w i d t h stands for the
numeric value 10. Once that equate is defined, the following two machine
instructions are exactly the same:

mov eax,10
mov eax,FieldWidth


EatLen: equ $-EatMsg

The assembly-time calculation is to take
the location represented by the $ token (which, when the calculation is done,
contains the location just past the end of the E a t M s g string) and subtract from
it location of the beginning of the E a t M s g string. End - Beginning = Length




In the x86 architecture, the top of the stack is marked by a register called the
stack pointer, with the formal name ESP. It's a 32-bit register, and it holds the
memory address of the last item pushed onto the stack.


the stack begins up at
the ceiling, and as items are pushed onto the stack, the stack grows downward,
toward low memory.




![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/stack_memory.png?raw=true "Title")


Push-y Instructions
You can place data onto the stack in several ways, but the most straightforward
way involves a group of five related machine instructions: PUSH, PUSHF, PUSHFD,
PUSHA, and PUSHAD. All work similarly, and differ mostly in what they push
onto the stack:
PUSH pushes a 16-bit or 32-bit register or memory value that is specified
by you in your source code.

• PUSHF 	pushes the 16-bit Flags register onto the stack.
• PUSHFD 	pushes the full 32-bit EFlags register onto the stack.
• PUSHA 	pushes all eight of the 16-bit general-purpose registers onto the stack.
• PUSHAD 	pushes all eight of the 32-bit general-purpose registers onto the stack.

![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/push_family.png?raw=true "Title")


![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/pop_family.png?raw=true "Title")


![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/stack_works.png?raw=true "Title")


One excellent use of the stack allows the all-too-few registers to do multiple
duty. If you need a register to temporarily hold some value to be operated on
by the CPU and all the registers are in use, push one of the busy registers onto
the stack. Its value will remain safe on the stack while you use the register for
other things. When you're finished using the register, pop its old value off the
stack—and you've gained the advantages of an additional register without
really having one

INT 00h - 0FFh 256 interrupts


The physical address is calculated from 2 parts. i) segment address. ii) offset address. The CS(code segment register) is used to address the code segment of the memory i.e a location in the memory where the code is stored. The IP(Instruction pointer) contains the offset within the code segment of the memory. Hence CS:IP is used to point to the location (i.e to calculate the physical address)of the code in the memory.

Since IP is 16 bit it means you can only have 64k instructions (2^16), which wasn't much even in the 80s. So to expand the address space you have a second register which addresses 64k blocks. You could consider cs:ip together as one 32 bit register which is then capable of addressing 2^32 bytes...ie 4G which is what you get on a processor which uses 32 bit addresses. The 8086 was using 20 bits of addresses, so you could access 1M of memory.


INT 00h - 0FFh 256 interrupts

1. Executes the INT instuction 
2. Interprets the INT instruction during the assembly time
3. Moves the INT instruction to the Vector Table
	1. Vector Table occupies location 00 to 3FF of the program memory
	2. It contains the Code Segment(CS) and Instruction Pointer(IP) for each kind of interrupt


At the very start of x86 memory, down at segment 0, offset 0, is a special
lookup table with 256 entries. Each entry is a complete memory address
including segment and offset portions, for a total of 4 bytes per entry. The first
1,024 bytes of memory in any x86 machine are reserved for this table, and no
other code or data may be placed there.
	
Each of the addresses in the table is called an interrupt vector. The table as a
whole is called the interrupt vector table.


![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/interrupt_vector_table.png?raw=true "Title")

![Alt text](../public/img/assembly/linux_booting_interrupt.png?raw=true "Title")

mov ecx,EatMsg
mov edx,EatLen 
int 80H 

This sequence of instructions requests that Linux display a text string on
the console. The first line sets up a vital piece of information: the number
of the service that we're requesting. In this case, it's to sys_write, service
number 4, which writes data to a Linux file. Remember that in Linux, just
about everything is a file, and that includes the console. The second line tells
Linux which file to write to: standard output. Every file must have a numeric
file descriptor, and the first three (0,1, and 2) are standard and never change.
The file descriptor for standard output is 1.
The third line places the address of the string to be displayed in ECX. That's
how Linux knows what it is that you want to display. The dispatcher expects
the address to be in ECX, but the address is simply where the string begins.
Linux also needs to know the string's length, and we place that value in
register EDX.


mov eax,1 	Specify Exit syscall
mov ebx,0 	Return a code of zero
int 80H 	Make syscall the to terminate the program


Exiting this way is not just a nicety. Every program you write must exit
by making a call to s y s _ e x i t through the kernel services dispatcher. If a
program just ''runs off the edge'' it will in fact end, but Linux will hand up a
segmentation fault and you'll be none the wiser as to what happened.



###  Software Interrupts versus Hardware Interrupts
hardware interrupts are numbered, and
for each interrupt number there is a slot reserved in the interrupt vector table.
In this slot is the address of an interrupt service routine (ISR) that performs
some action relevant to the device that tapped the CPU on the shoulder

 
The only real difference between hardware and software interrupts lies in
the event that triggers the trip through the interrupt vector table. With a
software interrupt, the triggering event is part of the software—that is, an INT
instruction. With a hardware interrupt, the triggering event is an electrical
signal applied to the CPU chip itself without any INT instruction taking a hand
in the process. The CPU itself pushes the return address onto the stack when
it recognizes the electrical pulse that triggers the interrupt; however, when the
ISR is done, an IRET instruction sends execution home, just as it does for a
software interrupt.


```
Write:	mov eax,4 		;Specify sys_write call
		mov ebx,1 		;Specify File Description 1 standad output
		mov ecx,Buff	;Pass address of the charecter to write
		mov edx,1		;Pass number of chars to write
		int 80H 		;Call sys_write...
```

EOF.


When you count bits, start with the bit on the right, and number them from 0.


SHL SHifts its

A 0 has been inserted at the right-hand end of the number, and the whole
shebang has been bumped toward the left by one digit.
The last bit shifted out of the left end of
the binary number is bumped into a temporary bucket for bits called the Carry
flag, generally abbreviated as CF.

ROL shifts all bits left and moves bit 7 to bit 0.
What was 10110010 is now 01100101

"Greater Than" Versus "Above"


To tell the signed jumps apart from the unsigned jumps, the mnemonics use
two different expressions for the relationship between two values:
• Signed values are thought of as being greater than or less than. For example,
to test whether one signed operand is greater than another, you would
use the JG (Jump if Greater) mnemonic after a CMP instruction.
• Unsigned values are thought of as being above or below. For example, to
tell whether one unsigned operand is greater than (above) another, you
would use the JA (Jump if Above) mnemonic after a CMP instruction.

The three basic modes of addressing are −

Register addressing
Immediate addressing
Memory addressing

#### Register Addressing

In this addressing mode, a register contains the operand. Depending upon the instruction, the register may be the first operand, the second operand or both.

For example,
```
MOV DX, TAX_RATE   ; Register in first operand
MOV COUNT, CX	   ; Register in second operand
MOV EAX, EBX	   ; Both the operands are in registers
```

#### Immediate Addressing
An immediate operand has a constant value or an expression. When an instruction with two operands uses immediate addressing, the first operand may be a register or memory location, and the second operand is an immediate constant. The first operand defines the length of the data.

For example,
```
BYTE_VALUE  DB  150    ; A byte value is defined
WORD_VALUE  DW  300    ; A word value is defined
ADD  BYTE_VALUE, 65    ; An immediate operand 65 is added
MOV  AX, 45H           ; Immediate constant 45H is transferred to AX
```


```
BYTE_TABLE DB  14, 15, 22, 45      ; Tables of bytes
WORD_TABLE DW  134, 345, 564, 123  ; Tables of words
```

The following operations access data from the tables in the memory into registers −

```
MOV CL, BYTE_TABLE[2]	; Gets the 3rd element of the BYTE_TABLE
MOV CL, BYTE_TABLE + 2	; Gets the 3rd element of the BYTE_TABLE
MOV CX, WORD_TABLE[3]	; Gets the 4th element of the WORD_TABLE
MOV CX, WORD_TABLE + 3	; Gets the 4th element of the WORD_TABLE
```


#### Indirect Memory Addressing

```
MY_TABLE TIMES 10 DW 0  ; Allocates 10 words (2 bytes) each initialized to 0
MOV EBX, [MY_TABLE]     ; Effective Address of MY_TABLE in EBX
MOV [EBX], 110          ; MY_TABLE[0] = 110
ADD EBX, 2              ; EBX = EBX +2
MOV [EBX], 123          ; MY_TABLE[1] = 123
```

```

Each byte of character is stored as its ASCII value in hexadecimal.
Each decimal value is automatically converted to its 16-bit binary equivalent and stored as a hexadecimal number.
Processor uses the little-endian byte ordering.
Negative numbers are converted to its 2's complement representation.
Short and long floating-point numbers are represented using 32 or 64 bits, respectively.


Multiple Initializations
The TIMES directive allows multiple initializations to the same value. For example, an array named marks of size 9 can be defined and initialized to zero using the following statement −
```
marks  TIMES  9  DW  0
```

#### Immediate addressing mode
	mov A,#23H ; #23H real value

accumilator ??

#### Direct addressing
	mov A,23H ; 23 addess value moves to A

	mov 23H,33H ; 33 addess value moves to adress 23


	mov 26H,#33H ; 33 value moves to address 26

#### Register Addessing
	


you can assign those variables with binary or hexadecimal values. Binary values would need to be appended by the letter 'b' at the end of the number. Likewise, hexadecimals with 'h' at the end. If the hexadecimal numbers start with letters (i.e. A, B, C, D, E, or F), you need to add a zero in front of that number and add an 'h' after that number.
```
bits  db 101001b
var2  dw 4567h
var3  dw 0BABEh
```


Similarly, you can load the variables to a register or store them back. You can even transfer values between registers.

```
mov bx, [our_var]
mov cx, bx
mov [our_var], cx
```
Note the square brackets when you deal with variables.
these square brackets are good to distinguish the variable from its address

There are caveats in using mov command. You CANNOT use mov [var1], [var2]. In other words, mov command cannot transfer values between two variables directly

So, how can we get around with this? Use the register.

Suppose both var1 and var2 are word variables. We can use any word registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, and so on) to do the transfer. Suppose we use AX. Thus, mov [var1], [var2] must be transformed into:

mov ax, [var2]
mov [var1],ax

The assembler actually treat variables as a label that has an address in the memory (RAM in most cases) associated to it. 


mov will read and write 2 bytes instead of 1. Likewise, using byte register to move a word variable will only transfer one byte instead of two.

```
 var2 db 2
   var3 dw 305h

start:
   mov ax, [var1]  ; ax now equals to 0201h (i.e. 2*256+1)
   mov ax, [var3]  ; ax now equals to 0305h
   mov ax, [var2]  ; ax now equals to 0502h
   mov al, [var3]  ; al now equals to 05h
```

```
MOV EAX,myvar2
```

The EAX register is now a pointer to myvar2. It does not contain the contents of myvar2 (which may not even be a double word), but it contains the address of myvar2.


##### Variables as Pointers
Once we have moved an address into a 32 bit register, we are then free to move it into a double word variable for storage.

For example, suppose that EAX has been loaded with the address of some memory location storing a byte of data and suppose that we have a double word variable mypoint, say, that we want to store this address in. We simply write
```		
MOV [mypoint],EAX
```
Now here comes the tricky part. Let's suppose we want to load the contents of the memory location now pointed to by mypoint, into the CH register. Firstly we have to retrieve the address from storage:
```
MOV EBX,[mypoint]
```

Now EBX points to the location in question. Now to retrieve the byte of data at that location, we write
```
MOV CH,[EBX]
```
Here the square brackets do not denote the contents of EBX itself (for which we would just write EBX), but rather, they denote the contents of the location pointed to by EBX.

Although this usage of the square brackets may seem different to the earlier usage, it is in reality the same thing, since the thing inside the brackets is basically a pointer in both cases.


 EAX used to be called the accumulator since it was used by a number of arithmetic operations, and ECX was known as the counter since it was used to hold a loop index.
 Whereas most of the registers have lost their special purposes in the modern instruction set, by convention, two are reserved for special purposes — the stack pointer (ESP) and the base pointer (EBP).
 
```
.DATA			
var	DB 64  		; Declare a byte, referred to as location var, containing the value 64.
var2	DB ?	; Declare an uninitialized byte, referred to as location var2.
DB 10			; Declare a byte with no label, containing the value 10. Its location is var2 + 1.
X	DW ?		; Declare a 2-byte uninitialized value, referred to as location X.
Y	DD 30000    ; Declare a 4-byte value, referred to as location Y, initialized to 30000.
```


#### C pointer 

```
#include <stdio.h>	
int main () {

   int  var = 20;   /* actual variable declaration */
   int  *ip;        /* pointer variable declaration */

   ip = &var;  /* store address of var in pointer variable*/

   printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var  );

   /* address stored in pointer variable */
   printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );

   /* access the value using the pointer */
   printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );

   return 0;
}
```

```

assembly number differnces decimal or hex or ansi??

Numerical data is generally represented in binary system. Arithmetic instructions operate on binary data. When numbers are displayed on screen or entered from keyboard, they are in ASCII form.



proc_name:
   procedure body
   ...
   ret
The procedure is called from another function by using the CALL instruction. The CALL instruction should have the name of the called procedure as an argument as shown below −

CALL proc_name

The C, C++, C#, Java, and other C-derivative programming languages use
the prefix “0x” to denote a hexadecimal value. Therefore, you’d use the
character sequence “0xdead” for the hexadecimal value DEAD16


 So for hexadecimal values that don’t
already begin with a numeric digit, you would add “0” to the beginning
of the value (adding a zero to the beginning of any numeric representation
does not alter the value of that representation). For example, use
“0deadh” to unambiguously represent the hexadecimal value DEAD

The conversion to decimal yields:
1 × 2^2 + 1 × 2^0 + 1 × 2^-2 = 4 + 1 + 0.25 = 5.25
