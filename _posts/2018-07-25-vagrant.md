Vagrant Share lets you share your Vagrant environment to anyone around the world with an Internet connection.


With Vagrant, you suspend, halt, or destroy the guest machine.

Suspending the virtual machine by calling vagrant suspend will save the current running state of the machine and stop it. When you are ready to begin working again, just run vagrant up, and it will be resumed from where you left off. The downside is that the virtual machine still eats up your disk space, and requires even more disk space to store all the state of the virtual machine RAM on disk.

Halting the virtual machine by calling vagrant halt will gracefully shut down the guest operating system and power down the guest machine.

Destroying the virtual machine by calling vagrant destroy will remove all traces of the guest machine from your system. It'll stop the guest machine, power it down, and remove all of the guest hard disks.
