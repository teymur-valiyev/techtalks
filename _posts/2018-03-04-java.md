# Java


Lets say we have a fairly standard java project that consists of three top level folders:

/bin - empty folder that will contain compiled .class files
/lib - contains third party .jar files
/src - contains .java source files

```
javac -d bin -sourcepath src -cp lib/lib1.jar;lib/lib2.jar src/com/example/Application.java

java -cp bin;lib/lib1.jar;lib/lib2.jar com.example.Application

```


javac -d classes -sourcepath src src\com\Helper.java

-sourcepath  => compile source file from src class 

-d classes  => output to classes directory


set CLASSPATH=classes  => global classpath
java com.Helper

java -classpath classes com.Helper 


http://www.sergiy.ca/how-to-compile-and-launch-java-code-from-command-line/


Core classes 
Extention classes 

Delegation 


rt.jar - core java classes 

ext/ - folder for extention classes

java -cp classes -Djava.ext.dirs=libs com.Helper

-Djava.ext.dirs=libs = define extention directory

java -Xbootclasspath - ovverides bootstrap class loader


delegation model

Bootstrap class loader  -  writed in c 
Extention class loader
Application class loader 


class type for class is singleton


```
package com.pluralsight;

import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLClassLoader;

public class Delegation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        URLClassLoader classLoader = (URLClassLoader) ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader();
        do {
            System.out.println(classLoader);        
            for (URL url : classLoader.getURLs()) {
                System.out.printf("\t %s\n", url.getPath());
            }
        } while ((classLoader = (URLClassLoader) classLoader.getParent()) != null);
        System.out.println("Bootstrap classloader");
    }
}
```


URLClassLoader 

```
package com.pluralsight;

import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLClassLoader;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        URL url;
        try {
            url = new URL("file:///c:/demos/lib/quoter.jar");
            URLClassLoader ucl = new URLClassLoader(new URL[]{url});
            Class clazz = ucl.loadClass("com.mantiso.Quote");
            Object o = clazz.newInstance();
            System.out.println(o.toString());
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (InstantiationException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```



using type direcly in line of code uses application classloader
com.cybernet.Helper 



interface loads from application classloader 
implentation own classloader



if using own classloader 
- cannont reference implementation in the code
- this will cause the class to be loaded with the app class loader

split code into implementation and interface
- interface definition go on the classpath
- implementation is loaded by our  classloader


Can write our own classloader
- Extend java.lang.ClassLoader
- May deligate first


defineClass(name, bytes, 0, bytes.length); // defince class 

```
Class.forName() - load class by class name

ClassLoader ucl = new URLClassLoader();
Class.forName("package.Class", true, ucl); // load class form classloader
```

```
Class helperCls = Class.forName("Helper", true, ucl);
HelperInterface helper = (Helper) helperCls.newInstance();

```

## JVM

java has always had 'strong' references
- Object not GC until references are released

Other types of references are aviable
- 'Special' class in java.lang.ref package
- Soft,Week and Phantom

WeekHashMap, ReferenceQueue

Strong -> Soft -> Weak -> Phantom

Soft will be collected if there is memory peressure
Weak will be collected immediately
Pantom referces different to the other two


```
Person person = new Person();
WeakReference<Person>  wr = new WeakReference<Person>(person);


Person person1 = wr.get(); // return strong object 


person = null;
Person p = wr.get(); // before GC return Person object

System.gc();
wr.get(); // return null

```

## Cloning


A clone is an exact copy of the original.

By default, java cloning is ‘field by field copy’ i.e. as the Object class does not have idea about the structure of class on which clone() method will be invoked. So, JVM when called for cloning, do following things:

1) If the class has only primitive data type members then a completely new copy of the object will be created and the reference to the new object copy will be returned.

2) If the class contains members of any class type then only the object references to those members are copied and hence the member references in both the original object as well as the cloned object refer to the same object.

A) You must implement Cloneable interface.
B) You must override clone() method from Object class. 

Java docs about clone() method are given below  

1. First statement guarantees that cloned object will have separate memory address assignment.
2. Second statement suggest that original and cloned objects should have same class type, but it is not mandatory.
3. Third statement suggest that original and cloned objects should have be equal using equals() method, but it is not mandatory.

```
public class Employee implements Cloneable{
 
    private int empoyeeId;
    private String employeeName;
    private Department department;
 
    public Employee(int id, String name, Department dept)
    {
        this.empoyeeId = id;
        this.employeeName = name;
        this.department = dept;
    }
    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

```
public class Department
{
    private int id;
    private String name;
 
    public Department(int id, String name)
    {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
    //Accessor/mutators methods will go there
}
```

```
public class TestCloning {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException
    {
        Department dept = new Department(1, "Human Resource");
        Employee original = new Employee(1, "Admin", dept);
        Employee cloned = (Employee) original.clone();

        System.out.println(cloned.getEmpoyeeId()); // 1
        System.out.println(original != cloned); // true
        System.out.println(original.getClass() == cloned.getClass()); //true
 
        //Default equals method checks for refernces so it should be false. If we want to make it true,
        //we need to override equals method in Employee class.
        System.out.println(original.equals(cloned)); // false

        cloned.getDepartment().setName("Finance");
 
        System.out.println(original.getDepartment().getName() // Finance
    }
}

```

### Shallow Cloning

This is default implementation in java. In overridden clone method, if you are not cloning all the object types (not primitives), then you are making a shallow copy.

### Deep cloning
It is the desired behavior in most the cases. We want a clone which is independent of original and making changes in clone should not affect original.
