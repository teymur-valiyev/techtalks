# Java


Lets say we have a fairly standard java project that consists of three top level folders:

/bin - empty folder that will contain compiled .class files
/lib - contains third party .jar files
/src - contains .java source files

```
javac -d bin -sourcepath src -cp lib/lib1.jar;lib/lib2.jar src/com/example/Application.java

java -cp bin;lib/lib1.jar;lib/lib2.jar com.example.Application

```

## Cloning


A clone is an exact copy of the original.

By default, java cloning is ‘field by field copy’ i.e. as the Object class does not have idea about the structure of class on which clone() method will be invoked. So, JVM when called for cloning, do following things:

1) If the class has only primitive data type members then a completely new copy of the object will be created and the reference to the new object copy will be returned.

2) If the class contains members of any class type then only the object references to those members are copied and hence the member references in both the original object as well as the cloned object refer to the same object.

A) You must implement Cloneable interface.
B) You must override clone() method from Object class. 

Java docs about clone() method are given below  

1. First statement guarantees that cloned object will have separate memory address assignment.
2. Second statement suggest that original and cloned objects should have same class type, but it is not mandatory.
3. Third statement suggest that original and cloned objects should have be equal using equals() method, but it is not mandatory.

```
public class Employee implements Cloneable{
 
    private int empoyeeId;
    private String employeeName;
    private Department department;
 
    public Employee(int id, String name, Department dept)
    {
        this.empoyeeId = id;
        this.employeeName = name;
        this.department = dept;
    }
    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

```
public class Department
{
    private int id;
    private String name;
 
    public Department(int id, String name)
    {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
    //Accessor/mutators methods will go there
}
```

```
public class TestCloning {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException
    {
        Department dept = new Department(1, "Human Resource");
        Employee original = new Employee(1, "Admin", dept);
        Employee cloned = (Employee) original.clone();

        System.out.println(cloned.getEmpoyeeId()); // 1
        System.out.println(original != cloned); // true
        System.out.println(original.getClass() == cloned.getClass()); //true
 
        //Default equals method checks for refernces so it should be false. If we want to make it true,
        //we need to override equals method in Employee class.
        System.out.println(original.equals(cloned)); // false

        cloned.getDepartment().setName("Finance");
 
        System.out.println(original.getDepartment().getName() // Finance
    }
}

```

### Shallow Cloning

This is default implementation in java. In overridden clone method, if you are not cloning all the object types (not primitives), then you are making a shallow copy.

### Deep cloning
It is the desired behavior in most the cases. We want a clone which is independent of original and making changes in clone should not affect original.
